Requirements:

This plugin requires the Elggx Userpoints plugin to be installed and enabled.



What this plugin does:

A user can select (via a dropdown menu selection) how many hours he worked on something and he will then be rewarded with a certain number of userpoints per hour of work.

It's a rather skeletal plugin (e.g. userpoints per hour defined as constant instead of plugin setting, no river entry etc.). I got a request for the underlying feature (input of a period of work and rewarding this work with userpoints) by Aiden and because I have an unfinished other plugin lying around that I was able to use to get the Userpoints balance plugin ready rather quickly I thought of publishing the plugin instead of describing how to implement it only.



Installation:

1. Copy the userpoints_balance plugin folder into you mod folder,
2. Enable the Userpoints balance plugin in the admin section of your site.


Changelog:

1.8.0:

- Initial release.
